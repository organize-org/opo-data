  opo-performance: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) ranks OPOs
    into 3 different tiers based on their performance. Rankings incorporate the
    number of donors and the number of organs transplanted. Many of the
    nation’s OPOs are failing to meet Tier 1 standards, leading to thousands of
    unnecessary deaths each year, which disproportionately harm patients of
    color. The map below shows the current ranking of U.S. OPOs by location,
    based on the most recent data available (2023). [Find more information

    Axios](https://www.axios.com/organ-donation-recovery-worse-people-of-color-8d42a213-4ef7-48a3-85fb-dd15cfc4301b.html):
    "Fewer Black donors correlates to fewer Black recipients, which has led to
    more Black dying on the organ transplant waitlist."'
  house-investigations: >-
    In 2020, the House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into 16 OPOs for “shocking mismanagement”, 
    among other conflicts and abuses, and, in 2021, expanded its investigation into the Nevada Donor Network for 
    “fraud, waste and abuse”, as well as potential conflicts of interest from industry in a study from the 
    National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM). Additionally, in 2025, the House Ways & Means Committee
    launched an investigation into 3 OPOs for "potential Medicare reimbursement fraud and abuse."

  senate-investigations: >-
    The Senate Finance Committee is more than three years into  a bipartisan investigation into the federal contractor 
    UNOS for “the inadequacy of UNOS’ oversight of OPOs” despite “lapses in patient safety, misuse of taxpayer dollars, 
    and tens of thousands of organs going unrecovered.” The Senate Finance Committee is also investigating many OPOs 
    directly for potentially fraudulent practices related to pancreas recovery, as well as into undisclosed financial 
    conflicts of interest among OPO executives.
