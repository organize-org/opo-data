      OPOs ranked by CMS Standardized Transplant Rate. 2023 data released by
      CMS May 2025. (See [CMS Quality Certification and Oversight
      Reports](https://qcor.cms.gov/main.jsp), linked to OPO Public Performance
      Report on left.) Legacy of Life (Hawaii) is excluded from CMS organ
      transplantation rate rankings due to “geographic challenges of the OPO
      servicing the Hawaii DSA”  which led to CMS using “the kidney
      transplantation rate for only the OPO serving the Hawaii DSA.” (See [CMS

      rule](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/112020-opo-final-rule-cms-3380-f.pdf).)
